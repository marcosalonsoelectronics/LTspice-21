Additional material for video LTspice #21: Three Ways to Obtain the Input Impedance of a DC-DC Converter by Simulation

Available at: https://youtu.be/ZXCcwmKXz9I

This video shows three ways to obtain the input impedance of a DC-DC converter by simulation. In the first part of the video the theoretical procedure to obtain the input impedance of a DC-DC converter is revisited. Then an example is presented, showing the theoretical input impedance plot obtained from a Winpython script. Finally, the three methods to obtain the input impedance by simulation are presented, namely, from the converter actual circuit, from the averaged circuit of the converter, and from the small-signal circuit of the converter.
